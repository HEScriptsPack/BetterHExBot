    * jSpaghetti update now allows the bot to use background script instead of sessionStorage what could be noticed by game server. The bot is already using background script as data storage.
    * sendXMLHttpRequest function was rewritten to optionally send the X-Requested-With header. It allows the bot to imitate the game behavior better, sending this header when necessary.
    * So the HE's technical guys will have more difficulty to track us.
    * Team, monitor the game requests headers and search for new headers. The HE's guys could create these headers to know who is not sending these headers (If the bot is not sending these headers, then it can be tracked).

## How to contribute
The bot is entirely written with [jSpaghetti](https://github.com/gresendesa/jSpaghetti) API. jSpaghetti provides a modular and declarative way to write scripts.
There are two ways to add new functionalities.
* Creating a new sequence into a existing module to related functionality; or
* Creating a module to build a new functionality.
